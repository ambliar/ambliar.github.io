<p>Hey, there!
    My name is Amber Blair. I am a mother of two children. I am a full-time employee and an aspiring academic leader.
    I have a 9-month-old basset hound, named Maggie Mae. I enjoy walking Maggie and teaching her new tricks.
    I seek to shape the future of learning through my academic pursuits and real-world experiences.
    I have a newfound love for coffee. I enjoy trying new blends and brews from local coffee shops.
    I am a true crime fan. I enjoy exploring criminal behavior and listening to true crime podcasts.
    I am a self-proclaimed plant mom. I enjoy gardening and tending to my plant babies.
    I enjoy walks and taking my children to local parks and recreation centers.
    I am completing my bachelors degree in Educational Studies.
    I plan to pursue a masters in arts in Educational Studies.
    I love the ⛰️🥾🧢🏞️🌍.
