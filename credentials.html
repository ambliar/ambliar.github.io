    <p>Hey, there!
        My name is Amber Blair. I am a mother of two children. I am a full-time employee and an aspiring academic leader.
        I have a 9-month-old basset hound named Maggie Mae. I enjoy walking Maggie and teaching her new tricks.
        I am a true crime fan. I enjoy exploring criminal behavior and listening to true crime podcasts.
        I seek to shape the future of learning through my academic pursuits and real-world experiences.
        I have a newfound love for coffee. I enjoy trying new blends and brews from local coffee shops.
        I am a self-proclaimed plant mom. I enjoy gardening and tending to my plant babies.
        I enjoy walks and taking my children to local parks and recreation centers.
        I am completing my Bachelor's  in Educational Studies.
        I plan to pursue a Master's in Arts in Educational Studies.
        I love the ⛰️🥾🧢🏞️🌍
